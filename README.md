# -Password-Strength-Tester-with-Alert-Indicator-Suggested-Use-Case-
In today’s digital age, passwords are the first line of defense for securing online accounts. However, many users still create weak or reused passwords, making their accounts vulnerable to cyberattacks such as brute-force, dictionary, or credential stuffing attacks.  To address this issue, this project presents a real-time password
To build a visually appealing web-based tool that:

Evaluates password strength dynamically

Provides visual feedback using color-coded indicators

Recommends where the password can be safely used (e.g., banking, social media, e-commerce)

Educates users about good password hygiene
